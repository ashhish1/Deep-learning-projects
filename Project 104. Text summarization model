Project 104. Text summarization model
Description:
Text summarization is the task of condensing a long document or paragraph into a shorter version while preserving key information. In this project, we use a pre-trained transformer model like T5 or BART from Hugging Face to perform abstractive summarization, where the model generates new text as the summary.

Python Implementation Using Hugging Face Transformers (T5)
# Install if not already: pip install transformers torch
 
from transformers import pipeline
 
# Load the summarization pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="t5-small", tokenizer="t5-small")
 
# Input text (can be a paragraph or document)
text = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world. 
From self-driving cars and personalized recommendations to virtual assistants and automated customer service, 
AI applications are everywhere. The technology uses algorithms and large datasets to learn patterns, 
make decisions, and even generate human-like text and images. While AI offers immense potential, 
it also raises ethical concerns around bias, job displacement, and privacy. 
Understanding how AI works is becoming increasingly important for both individuals and organizations.

# Generate summary
summary = summarizer("summarize: " + text, max_length=50, min_length=20, do_sample=False)
 
# Print result
print("üîç Original Text:\n", text, "\n")
print("üìù Summary:\n", summary[0]['summary_text'])
üìò What This Project Demonstrates:
Performs abstractive text summarization using T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

Converts long text into concise summaries

Shows how pre-trained models can be directly applied to real-world data
