Project 127. Seq2Seq for text summarization
Description:
Text summarization using Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) models involves generating a concise summary from a longer piece of text. In this project, we use a pre-trained transformer-based Seq2Seq model, such as T5 or BART, to perform abstractive summarization, meaning the model generates new words not just extracted from the original.

Python Implementation Using Hugging Face T5 Model
# Install if not already: pip install transformers torch
 
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
 
# Load pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)
 
# Input long text to summarize
text = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. 
It is a rapidly evolving field with applications in healthcare, finance, automotive, and more. 
AI systems use data and algorithms to perform tasks such as image recognition, language translation, and decision-making.
"""
 
# Prepend task prefix and tokenize
input_text = "summarize: " + text
inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
 
# Generate summary
summary_ids = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50, min_length=20, length_penalty=2.0, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
 
# Decode and print summary
summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("üìù Original Text:\n", text)
print("\n‚úÇÔ∏è Generated Summary:\n", summary)
üß† What This Project Demonstrates:
Uses a Seq2Seq transformer (T5) for abstractive summarization

Generates new phrases and structure for a fluent summary

Works out-of-the-box on long-form content like articles or reports
